Security
1.	Is My Synovus secure?
My Synovus uses two-step authentication process to keep your accounts secure. This means we use multiple layers of security to verify your identity and protect your accounts beyond your username and password.

2.	Can I change my username through My Synovus?
Yes. Go to Settings: My Security. You must have your current username and password in order to change your username. Keep in mind, if you change your username, your old username will no longer be valid and can’t be used again in the future.

3.	Can I change how I receive the verification code for one-time passcode? (Change from a phone call to a text message.)
Yes. To change how you receive your verification codes for your one-time passcode you’ll need to perform a one-time passcode reset. Go to Settings: My Security. Once you initiate the reset, you will be prompted on your next login to select how you would like to receive your authentication codes. At that point, you may select SMS or Voice Call. You can add additional phone numbers or change the phone numbers available by calling Customer Care at 1-888-SYNOVUS (1-888-796-6887) or visiting Settings: My Profile.

To view, manage or remove any devices associated with mobile banking, go to Settings: My Mobile.

6.	Will my account numbers be displayed in their entirety?
No. For added security, your account numbers will be masked with an asterisk (*) up to the last four digits. Loan accounts will display eight digits, the last four are the note number of the loan and the first four are the last four digits of the actual loan number.
Examples:
Checking = ******1567
Loans = *******12350001

7.	What can I do to protect my account?
Good security starts at home, at the office or wherever you access your account. We suggest that you:
o	Create longer passwords that use a combination of letters and numbers. Avoid using family member or pet names, birthdates and phone numbers.
o	Never write down or share your password. The same holds true for your security questions and answers.
o	Change passwords regularly. Do not alternate between the same passwords.
o	When you log in to My Synovus you’re in a secure session. Make sure by looking for a padlock symbol on the lower right-hand corner of your browser or by looking at the web address – it should start with https://.
o	Only use My Synovus on computers with up-to-date anti-virus and anti-spam software. Install a personal firewall, especially if you use a broadband connection.
o	Sign off from My Synovus if you must step away from your computer or you have completed your tasks.
o	Be wary of correspondence that asks you to disclose your password or account detail. Remember, we will never ask you to provide private information by email.
