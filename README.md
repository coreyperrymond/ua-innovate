# UA Innovate Hackathon &amp; Innovation Challenge - Chatbot

## Description of Prompt 

This prompt is targeted towards technical and analytical students. 
Chatbots have become quite popular in recent years. They are bots that interact with users through a text or text-to-speech conversation. Chatbots enhance the user experience by answering the user’s questions as a human would. This interaction has become increasingly intelligent and can blend analytics, APIs, and AI. 

**As a developer** create a chatbot and UI that takes input and provides a response to customer inquiry’s such as account # and balances. Utilize the FAQ data provided below to answer common customer questions. The UI design should be aesthetically pleasing, responsive and use colors like Synovus.com. 

**As a data analyst** perform analysis on dataset to factor into customer interactions based on customer input and provided dataset.
